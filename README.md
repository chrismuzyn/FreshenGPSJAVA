# FreshenGPSJAVA
Used to refresh an AGPS device's almanac files.

Currently not user friendly.

I bought a Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle HR last week, and discovered the watch's gps cold starts take upwards of 10 minutes.  I am hoping to get an app that I can launch from a side button that will refresh the AGPS almanac data while I'm connected to a network, so that way when disconnected, it will be faster.
